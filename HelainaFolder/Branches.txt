Branches on GitHub
1. Create your own branch using command 
	git checkout -b <new_branch>
2.. add/work
3. git add [modified file/folder]
4. git commit -m "Message"
5. git push --set-upstream origin <new_branch> 
6. Then can create pull request to add this to main

May be easier ways to do this via VS Code but this is how to by terminal
set upstream may only be neccasary first time?
